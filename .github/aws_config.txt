CloudFormation >> Stacks >> SaaSLocalTsStack
Delete

CloudFormation >> Stacks >> CDKToolkit
Delete

Things not automatically deleted

These can persist outside the stack if created manually or by the CDK bootstrap process:

ECR repositories

Check ECR → Repositories

If you see api, ai, web, or cdk-hnb659fds-container-assets-*, delete them (make sure to empty images first).

SSM parameters

Go to Systems Manager → Parameter Store

Look for /saas-local-ts/apiImageTag, /aiImageTag, /webImageTag, or /cdk-bootstrap/* and delete if you no longer need them.

S3 buckets (rare, only if you had asset buckets not managed by CloudFormation)

CDK bootstrap creates an asset bucket (cdk-hnb659fds-assets-*). If that stack is still there, you might need to delete it separately.

KMS keys (if bootstrap created one)

Check KMS → Customer managed keys for unused cdk-* keys.


Manual but thorough checklist (if you don’t want aws-nuke)

To ensure zero billing, you must delete resources in all regions. Check:

CloudFormation → delete all stacks (SaaSLocalTsStack, CDKToolkit, etc.)

ECS → clusters + services

ECR → repos (api, ai, web, cdk-hnb659fds-…)

S3 → buckets (empty, then delete)

EC2 → instances, load balancers, target groups, key pairs

RDS / DynamoDB / ElastiCache / OpenSearch → delete clusters/tables/domains

CloudWatch → log groups (optional, small cost)

SSM Parameters / Secrets Manager → delete custom params/secrets

IAM → inline roles/policies you no longer need

KMS → customer-managed keys (cost $1/mo each)

Quick Cleanup Commands (CLI)
List running EC2 instances:
aws ec2 describe-instances --query "Reservations[].Instances[?State.Name=='running'].[InstanceId,InstanceType]" --region <your-region>

Delete ECR images:
aws ecr list-images --repository-name <repo> --region <region>
aws ecr batch-delete-image --repository-name <repo> --image-ids imageDigest=<digest>

🧹 Tip: Use cdk destroy to Clean Infra

If you're using AWS CDK for infrastructure, you can clean it up easily with:

npx cdk destroy


It will prompt to delete everything created in the stack (ECS, ECR, RDS, etc.).

-----------------------------------------------------------------

npx cdk destroy >> will it destroy all instances, images everything so as to reduce charges to 0
ChatGPT said:

Yes — running **npx cdk destroy** can destroy everything that was created by your CDK stack, including:

✅ ECS clusters and services

✅ EC2 instances (if any were created)

✅ RDS databases (if not protected)

✅ ElastiCache (Redis)

✅ OpenSearch domains

✅ ECR repositories

✅ S3 buckets

✅ IAM roles and policies

✅ CloudWatch log groups

✅ VPCs and subnets

✅ Lambda functions

...and more

⚠️ BUT — Important Warnings
❗ It only destroys resources created by that CDK stack

It won’t touch resources created manually in the AWS Console or by other stacks/scripts

It won’t delete images inside ECR repositories unless explicitly configured

It may fail to destroy S3 buckets if they’re not empty (unless removalPolicy: DESTROY is set)

✅ What cdk destroy actually does

It uses CloudFormation under the hood to:

Identify all resources in the CDK stack

Issue delete commands to AWS

Wait until all deletions are complete

You will be prompted with something like:

Are you sure you want to delete: stack-name (y/n)?

🧹 How to ensure complete cleanup (and reduce charges to 0)
Step-by-step cleanup checklist:
Task	Command or Console
✅ Destroy all CDK stacks	npx cdk destroy (for each stack)
🧼 Empty S3 buckets if destroy fails	AWS Console or CLI
❌ Delete unused ECR repos or images	aws ecr delete-repository or Console
⛔ Delete EC2 instances manually	EC2 Console
💾 Delete RDS snapshots (not auto-deleted)	RDS Console
📦 Delete manually created resources	Console or CLI
🧾 Review usage/cost in Billing dashboard	Billing Console
🛡️ Bonus Tip: Check what will be destroyed (Dry Run)

Before destroying, you can see what will be deleted by running:

npx cdk diff


It won’t delete anything — just shows the changes (add/remove) that will happen.

✅ Example Safe Cleanup Flow
# Navigate to your CDK project
cd .infra/cdk

# Destroy your stack (you'll be prompted to confirm)
npx cdk destroy


You can pass the stack name if you have multiple:

npx cdk destroy MyStackName

Want help checking your stack's current resources or a safe cleanup order?

You can run npx cdk list and send me the output. I’ll guide you through a complete cleanup.

aws-nuke
ChatGPT said:

Alright 👍 let’s walk through aws-nuke — the community-standard tool to wipe all resources in an AWS account and guarantee $0 charges.

🔹 What is aws-nuke?

Open-source tool: rebuy-de/aws-nuke

Iterates through all AWS services & regions

Deletes everything (EC2, ECS, RDS, S3, ECR, IAM, CloudFormation, etc.)

⚠️ Irreversible → use only on non-production or test accounts

🔹 Install aws-nuke

macOS (Homebrew):

brew install aws-nuke


Linux / Windows:

Download the latest release from GitHub → aws-nuke releases

Extract the binary and add it to your $PATH.

🔹 Prepare config file

Create aws-nuke-config.yml in your local machine:

regions:
  - "global"
  - "us-east-1"
  - "us-east-2"
  - "us-west-1"
  - "us-west-2"
  - "ap-south-1"       # Mumbai (you likely used this)
  - "ap-southeast-1"
  - "ap-southeast-2"
  - "ap-northeast-1"
  - "ap-northeast-2"
  - "eu-central-1"
  - "eu-west-1"
  - "eu-west-2"
  - "eu-west-3"
  - "sa-east-1"

accounts:
  "752095361522":   # << your AWS Account ID
    filters: {}


👉 filters: {} means delete everything.
If you want to keep some resources (e.g., an IAM user or S3 bucket), you can add filters.

🔹 Run aws-nuke

Dry run first (see what it will delete):

aws-nuke -c aws-nuke-config.yml --profile myprofile


Actually delete (no dry run):

aws-nuke -c aws-nuke-config.yml --profile myprofile --no-dry-run


Replace myprofile with the AWS CLI profile that has admin privileges on your account.

You’ll need to type --no-dry-run explicitly, or it won’t delete anything.

🔹 After it runs

CloudFormation, ECS, ECR, EC2, S3, RDS, DynamoDB, ElastiCache, IAM roles, etc. → all gone.

Check in AWS Console → there should be nothing left in any region.

Billing → within a few hours, usage will drop to zero.

⚠️ Warning:

This is a destructive operation — there’s no undo.

Don’t run on any account you still need resources in.

If you just want to clean one project, deleting the CloudFormation stacks + ECR + S3 manually is safer.

👉 Do you want me to generate a ready-to-use aws-nuke-config.yml with your account ID and only the regions you actually used (so it runs faster)?

Option A (recommended for greenfield): Schema-first with Pydantic v2 + OpenAPI

Source of truth: Pydantic models (DTOs) → model_json_schema() for contracts.

API: DRF or FastAPI emits OpenAPI from those models.

DB: Django models stay persistence-first; keep only operational metadata here.

Cross-cutting metadata (PII, labels, retention, enum semantics): put into Pydantic Field(..., json_schema_extra=...) so it propagates to docs, clients, and UI scaffolding.

Search: A small mapper translates DTOs → OpenSearch index docs (and tags which fields are searchable/embeddable).
