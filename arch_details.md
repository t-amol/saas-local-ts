In morning you given me repo saas-local-ts where No cloud credentials, no AWS account required. Everything runs via Docker Compose >> I am able to run this now >> give me the the further explanation and understanding
ChatGPT said:

awesome—since you’ve got the stack running, here’s a clear mental model of what’s running, how requests/data flow, where to look in code, and what to tweak next. I’ll keep it practical so you can navigate and extend confidently.

What each service does (and why)

Nginx (reverse-proxy, :8080)
Single entry point. Routes /app/* to the React SPA, /api/* to Django+Gunicorn, and optionally exposes OpenSearch Dashboards and Grafana. Mimics a production front-door locally.

Frontend (React + TypeScript + Webpack + LESS)
SPA talking to /api/*. Type-safe API calls (axios/fetch). E2E tests via Playwright.

Django + DRF + Gunicorn (web API, :8000)
“Control plane” and source of truth. Handles auth, CRUD, validation, orchestration of search, RAG, storage, and background jobs. Gunicorn gives you a prod-like WSGI server.

Postgres
Transactional database for domain entities, jobs/audit, and anything relational.

Redis
Broker + result backend for Celery; also great for small caches, rate limits, and feature flags.

Celery (worker + beat)
Heavy/async work: file ingestion, PyArrow parsing, embedding, FAISS/OpenSearch indexing, exports. Beat runs scheduled tasks (nightly reindex, cleanup, etc.).

MinIO (S3-compatible, :9001 console)
Stores raw uploads, exports, model snapshots, FAISS index snapshots. All S3 APIs, zero cloud creds.

OpenSearch (:9200, Dashboards :5601)
Text/BM25 and vector (dense_vector) search. Use it for keyword, filters, aggregations, and hybrid retrieval.

RAG Service (FastAPI, :8001)
Isolates ML deps. Creates embeddings (sentence-transformers), queries FAISS for semantic neighbors, optionally hybridizes with OpenSearch BM25, and returns contexts/scores.

DuckDB
Fast local analytics over Parquet/CSV. Perfect for summaries/pivots feeding charts without hitting Postgres.

DynamoDB-Local
Low-latency KV for idempotency keys, per-tenant config, or quick feature toggles—no AWS required.

(Optional) Loki + Promtail + Grafana
Centralized logs and simple dashboards (“CloudWatch-like”) for API latency, worker durations, errors.

How a user request flows (typical read path)

Browser hits GET /app/ → Nginx serves SPA.

SPA calls GET /api/v1/items?query=aspirin.

DRF fetches canonical records from Postgres (joins optimized with select_related/prefetch_related).

(Optional) DRF also asks OpenSearch for ranking/recall, merges results, returns JSON.

SPA renders list/detail; any charts can query small “analytics” endpoints that read from DuckDB.

How ingestion works (upload → searchable)

SPA uploads file(s) → DRF stores raw object in MinIO.

DRF enqueues a Celery job with object key and metadata.

Worker downloads from MinIO → parses with PyArrow → materializes clean tables into DuckDB.

Worker text-splits/normalizes content → indexes docs to OpenSearch (BM25 + optional vector field).

Worker also embeds chunks using RAG service (or directly via a worker model) → updates FAISS.

Worker writes ingestion audit/status to Postgres + DDB (idempotency, job status).

How RAG/semantic search works

SPA or DRF calls RAG /search?q=...&k=8.

RAG embeds the query (sentence-transformers) → queries FAISS top-K contexts.

(Optional) RAG queries OpenSearch BM25 for the same query and performs hybrid re-ranking.

RAG returns contexts + scores to DRF → DRF returns stitched answer + sources.

Ports & endpoints (quick map)

App entry: http://localhost:8080

API: proxied at /api/* (Gunicorn listens 8000 inside network)

RAG: http://localhost:8001

OpenSearch: http://localhost:9200 (Dashboards http://localhost:5601)

MinIO console: http://localhost:9001

Grafana (if enabled): routed via Nginx as configured (e.g., /grafana)

Common commands & smoke tests

Bring it up / rebuild

docker compose up -d --build
docker compose logs -f web worker rag opensearch


Django setup

docker compose exec web python manage.py migrate
docker compose exec web python manage.py createsuperuser
docker compose exec web python manage.py seed_demo


Quick API smoke

curl -s http://localhost:8080/api/health
curl -s "http://localhost:8080/api/v1/items?query=aspirin"


RAG smoke

curl -s "http://localhost:8001/search?q=aspirin&k=5" | jq .


OpenSearch check

curl -s http://localhost:9200/_cluster/health | jq .
curl -s http://localhost:9200/_cat/indices?v


Playwright (from frontend container)

docker compose exec frontend npx playwright test

Where to look in the code (typical files)

DRF views/serializers: backend/app/views.py, serializers.py

Celery tasks: backend/app/tasks.py (ingestion, index, export)

MinIO utility: backend/app/storage_minio.py (put/get, presign if needed)

OpenSearch client: backend/app/search_opensearch.py (index/search, hybrid helpers)

RAG client: backend/app/rag_client.py (timeouts, schema)

DuckDB helpers: backend/app/duckdb_utils.py (read parquet/csv, materialize views)

RAG service: rag_service/app.py (routes), rag_service/ingest.py (index build/refresh)

Performance & reliability tips (local now, prod-ready later)

DB querying: use select_related/prefetch_related; add functional indexes for common filters.

Search: start simple BM25; enable vector later. For hybrid, try reciprocal-rank fusion (RRF) or weighted sum.

Celery: separate queues (ingestion, embeddings, exports) and concurrency per queue. Add retry/backoff for I/O.

Idempotency: use DDB-Local to store idempotency keys for POSTs that trigger long jobs.

Rate limits: DRF throttling + Redis token bucket on expensive endpoints (search/RAG/export).

Index rotation: snapshot FAISS to MinIO and expose a RAG /refresh endpoint to atomically swap indexes.

Observability: log JSON lines; add Grafana panels for API latency, 95p task duration, queue depth, OS query time.

Multi-tenant: propagate tenant_id through DRF middleware; include in DB rows, OpenSearch docs, DDB keys, MinIO prefixes.

Troubleshooting quickies

Celery “inspect ping” fails
Check env: CELERY_BROKER_URL=redis://redis:6379/1 and worker service on same network.
docker compose exec worker celery -A config inspect ping
If it loops, verify Redis is healthy (docker compose logs redis) and that worker sees the broker.

OpenSearch index mapping errors
Create templates before ingest. Keep a small infra/opensearch/index-templates.sh to POST mappings (including dense_vector).

RAG model download slow
First run will cache models under a mounted volume; subsequent runs are instant. You can pre-warm by running rag_service/ingest.py.

CORS/CSRF during local dev
Keep permissive in settings.py for dev only; tighten later.

Suggested next steps (easy wins)

Add /api/health and /api/ready endpoints with checks for DB, Redis, OpenSearch, RAG.

Playwright test for the full happy path: upload → wait for ingestion badge → search → open detail.

Hybrid search toggle in config; measure latency/quality with a tiny eval set.

Makefile helpers: make seed, make reindex, make smoke, make clean.

Docs: add docs/Architecture.md (with the Mermaid diagrams we prepared) + docs/Runbook.md for common ops.

If you tell me your preferred first feature (e.g., “CSV-to-searchable docs with entity tagging”, “FAQ RAG with sources”, or “analytics dashboard from DuckDB”), I’ll sketch the endpoint contract, DB changes, task flow, and a 1-day implementation plan tailored to this repo.
